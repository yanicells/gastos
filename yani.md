Main Functions
- log gastos (date, type, amount, notes)
- view, edit, delete logs (batch and single)
- charts and graph with filters (types, period (month, week, year))

Future
- maybe have another table for analytics stuff - so that less queries are needed (see how to implement - if after imports or what)
