Main Functions
- log gastos (date, type, amount, notes)

- charts and graph with filters (types, period (month, week, year))

To do
- implement the analytics
- select day or week or month for simple breakdown
- dropdown - it should drop down under the selector - similar to the dropdowns in the home page
- round the corners in the /summary page

Simple stats (for dashboard)
- like averages per month day week 
- current month stats - expenses, income, savings

Future
- maybe have another table for analytics stuff - so that less queries are needed
