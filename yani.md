Main Functions
- log gastos (date, type, amount, notes)
- view, edit, delete logs (batch and single)
- charts and graph with filters (types, period (month, week, year))

To do
- imports
- fix types (ensure works with previous logs - and future logs easy to incorporate)
- fonts (family and size and style)
- test pwa - try alternatives where pwa + turbopack

Future
- maybe have another table for analytics stuff - so that less queries are needed (see how to implement - if after imports or what)
